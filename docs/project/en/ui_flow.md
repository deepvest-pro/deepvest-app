# UI Flow - DeepVest Interface Description

This document describes the interface architecture of the DeepVest platform, based on content-first and mobile-first principles, using the Radix UI component library.

## 1. Interface Design Principles

### 1.1 Content-First Approach

Content forms the foundation of all interface solutions. Structure, hierarchy, and visual presentation are subordinated to content and optimized for its effective delivery. Design decisions are made only after determining information architecture and content sequence, ensuring an intuitive and efficient user experience.

### 1.2 Mobile-First Approach

Design is primarily developed for mobile devices with subsequent progressive enhancement for larger screens. This ensures optimal UX across all devices and focuses attention on priority content. The responsive grid uses breakpoints: mobile (320px - 767px), tablet (768px - 1023px), desktop (1024px+).

### 1.3 Technological Foundation

The interface is built on the Radix UI library, which ensures component accessibility, semantic structure, and a solid foundation for customization. The library was chosen in accordance with technical requirements and provides all necessary primitives for creating complex interfaces.

## 2. Design System

### 2.1 Typography

The typographic system is built on a system font stack (SF Pro, Segoe UI, Roboto), ensuring optimal display across all platforms without additional loading. The heading hierarchy (H1-H4) has adaptive sizes that scale proportionally with screen width through CSS variables. Text scaling follows a modular scale with a 1.25 ratio, creating harmonious and consistent typography.

### 2.2 Color System

The color palette is built around three primary colors: primary blue (#3D5AF1), secondary green (#22C55E), and accent orange (#F97316). The system is complemented by neutral shades (from white #FFFFFF to black #111827) with 10 gray gradations for creating depth and contrast. Semantic colors provide contextual feedback: success (green), warning (orange), error (red), and information (blue).

### 2.3 Component Model

Interface architecture is built on atomic design principles using Radix UI primitives. Components are organized into the following levels:

1. **Fundamental Primitives**: basic building blocks of the interface, including text fields, buttons, checkboxes, and other form elements.

2. **Composite Components**: combinations of primitives to create self-sufficient interface elements (project cards, search forms, navigation elements).

3. **Templates**: page structures and layout patterns that define overall content organization.

4. **Pages**: complete screens combining components to solve specific user tasks.

The component approach ensures consistency, reusability, and interface scalability.

## 3. Main Screens and User Scenarios

### 3.1 Landing Page

The landing page focuses on quickly conveying the platform's key value through visual storytelling. The page is structured as a sequence of thematic sections, each revealing a specific aspect of DeepVest's value proposition. Users can quickly understand the service's essence and benefits for their target group (startup or investor). Visual examples of interface and data demonstrate system functionality without technical information overload.

### 3.2 Authentication and Registration

The authentication system offers a smooth and secure process with minimal friction. Users can choose a convenient login method: via email/password or social networks (Google, LinkedIn, X, GitHub). The registration process is divided into logical steps, performed on one screen for desktop and sequentially for mobile devices. After registration completion, personalized onboarding follows, adapting to the user's role in the ecosystem (founder, investor, team member).

### 3.3 User Dashboard

The dashboard provides a centralized control panel adapted to user context. Founders see an overview of their projects, view statistics, recent scoring updates, and improvement recommendations. Information blocks are organized by priority: critical information and elements requiring attention are positioned at the top.

### 3.4 Project Leaderboard

The leaderboard ensures intuitive project exploration with a multi-level filtering and sorting system. Users can customize the view according to their preferences. Projects are presented as informative cards displaying key metrics and AI scoring. When interacting with cards, users get additional context without needing to navigate to separate pages, speeding up the exploration process.

### 3.5 Project Profile

The project profile is structured around various information aspects: overview, team, content, metrics, funding, milestones, and social proof. Navigation between sections is implemented through a tab system with quick access to the most demanded data. Visualizations and charts present complex data in an intuitively understandable format. The interface ensures deep project immersion and forms a holistic view of its potential.

### 3.6 Project Creation and Editing

The project editor provides a structured process for creating and updating information with contextual hints and AI recommendations. The system helps founders present their project most favorably, focusing on key aspects of interest to investors. The preview interface allows assessment of how the project will look to visitors, while the snapshot mechanism ensures safe version management and change publication.

### 3.7 User Profile

The user profile serves as the center for personal information and settings. It allows managing personal data, professional experience, social connections, and platform preferences. The interface ensures simple data editing with instant preview of changes. For other users, the profile represents a professional business card, strengthening trust in the ecosystem.
The user profile also displays all projects in which they are involved.

## 4. Interface Interactivity and Responsiveness

### 4.1 Component States

Interactive elements have clearly defined visual states (default, hover, active, focus, disabled, loading), ensuring interaction predictability. Transitions between states are accompanied by smooth visual changes that serve as natural feedback and confirm user actions. Focus states ensure accessibility during keyboard navigation, while loading states inform about asynchronous operation execution.

### 4.2 Animations and Transitions

The animation system is built on functionality and restraint principles. Micro-animations lasting 150-300ms with ease-out timing function ensure smoothness without slowing the interface. All animations and transitions should maximally use built-in Radix UI mechanics. They are applied in the following contexts:

1. **Functional Feedback**: visual confirmation of user actions (pulsation on click, shake on error, success action indication)

2. **State Transitions**: smooth appearance/disappearance of elements, container size changes, component transformations

3. **Navigational Transitions**: smooth transitions between pages and tabs, preserving context and spatial orientation

4. **Narrative Animations**: sequential appearance of elements during first viewing of key sections to direct attention

Animations are optimized for performance, using GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity) and avoiding animation of expensive properties (box-shadow, filter).

### 4.3 Adaptive Behavior

The adaptive strategy is based on a flexible grid, relative measurement units, and breakpoints. The interface dynamically adjusts to available space, applying the following approaches:

1. **Content-Oriented Breakpoints**: breaking points are determined not by devices but by optimal content representation

2. **Progressive Enhancement**: basic functionality is available on all devices, extended functionality on devices with appropriate screen space

3. **Context-Dependent Interfaces**: controls, indents, font sizes, and information density adapt to device capabilities

4. **Gesture Interactions**: natural gesture interactions are available on touch devices (swipe, pinch-zoom, long press)

All functionality is preserved on any device; only the way it's presented and interacted with changes.

## 5. Technical Implementation Aspects

## 7. Navigation and Information Architecture

The platform's information architecture is built on contextual relevance and progressive disclosure principles. Global navigation provides access to main sections (leaderboard, projects, profile), supplemented by contextual navigation within each section. Local navigation uses breadcrumbs for hierarchical structures and tabs for parallel content categories.

The search system provides unified content access with intelligent result categorization. Filtering and sorting adapt to context and preserve user preferences. The navigation structure corresponds to target users' mental models, ensuring intuitive orientation in the information space.

## 8. Responsive Design

The adaptivity strategy is built on fluid containers and modular grid, ensuring design integrity on any device. Content, not device, determines interface restructuring points. Main breakpoints (320px, 768px, 1024px) correspond to optimal thresholds for content reorganization.

On small devices, the interface prioritizes main content, hiding or grouping secondary elements into available-on-demand components. With increasing screen space, richer functionality gradually unfolds. However, even on mobile devices, users have access to all critical system functions; only their presentation method changes.

The "progressive disclosure" approach applies not only to screen sizes but also to user flow states, ensuring contextual interface relevance at each interaction stage.

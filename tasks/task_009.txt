Create database schema for storing user search history and saved searches. Implement search history tracking with timestamps. Develop UI for viewing and managing search history. Add functionality to save, name, and categorize searches. Implement notification system for saved search updates. Ensure privacy controls for search history. Design UI for quick re-execution of previous searches. Optimize storage for high-volume search history. Add export functionality for search history.

## 4. Discovery Feed with Recommendations [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.3
### Description: Develop a personalized discovery feed with content recommendations based on user behavior
### Details:
Implement collaborative filtering algorithm for recommendations. Create content-based recommendation engine. Develop user behavior tracking system. Design discovery feed UI with infinite scroll. Implement A/B testing framework for recommendation algorithms. Ensure recommendation diversity to prevent filter bubbles. Add feedback mechanisms for improving recommendations. Optimize recommendation generation for performance (<500ms). Implement caching strategy for recommendation results.

## 5. API Endpoints and Analytics [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Create comprehensive API endpoints for search functionality and implement analytics tracking
### Details:
Design RESTful API endpoints for all search capabilities. Implement GraphQL support for complex search queries. Create comprehensive API documentation. Add rate limiting and security measures. Implement search analytics tracking (popular terms, zero-result searches). Create dashboard for search performance metrics. Set up monitoring for search latency and errors. Implement A/B testing framework for search features. Ensure API endpoints meet performance SLAs (avg <300ms response time).

## Project Deletion Implementation Details ✅ **COMPLETED**

### Implementation Summary

- **Delete Button**: Added trash icon button visible only to project owners
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Radix UI AlertDialog with project name confirmation
- **Server Action**: Secure `deleteProject` function with proper authentication
- **Database**: Cascade deletion via existing foreign key constraints
- **Navigation**: Client-side redirect using Next.js `router.push()`
- **UX**: Toast notifications for success/error states

### Files Modified for Deletion Feature

- `src/components/projects/ProjectDetails.tsx` - Added delete button and confirmation dialog
- `src/app/projects/[id]/actions.ts` - Added `deleteProject` server action
- `src/app/api/projects/[id]/route.ts` - DELETE endpoint (already existed)
- Database schema - Cascade deletion via foreign key constraints (already configured)

### Security & Permissions

- Only project owners can see and use the delete button
- Server action validates user authentication and ownership
- Database constraints ensure proper cascade deletion
- No orphaned data remains after deletion

### User Experience

- Clear visual confirmation dialog with project name
- Loading states during deletion process
- Success toast notification before redirect
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Smooth navigation back to projects list

**READY FOR NEXT TASK:** The core project editing and deletion functionality is complete and working. The system supports creating, editing, publishing, and deleting projects with proper security and user experience.

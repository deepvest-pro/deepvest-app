# Task ID: 2
# Title: Authentication System Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement user authentication with email/password and OAuth providers (Google, LinkedIn, X, GitHub) using Supabase Auth.
# Details:
1. Create authentication context using React Context API
2. Implement email/password sign up with email verification
3. Implement OAuth authentication for Google, LinkedIn, X, and GitHub
4. Create protected routes with authentication checks
5. Implement session management and persistence
6. Create sign in, sign up, and password reset pages
7. Add email verification workflow
8. Implement logout functionality
9. Create ZOD schemas for authentication data validation
10. Add error handling for authentication failures

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration, login, and logout flows. Verify email verification process. Test OAuth providers individually. Ensure protected routes redirect unauthenticated users. Test password reset functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Authentication Context and Core Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the authentication context and core functionality that will serve as the foundation for the entire authentication system.
### Details:
1. Create an AuthContext using React Context API to manage authentication state globally
2. Implement core authentication hooks (useAuth, useUser) for components to access auth state
3. Set up secure token storage mechanism (HTTP-only cookies preferred over localStorage)
4. Create authentication API service with proper error handling
5. Implement CSRF protection mechanisms
6. Security considerations: Use HTTPS, implement rate limiting, secure token storage
7. Testing: Manually verify context and hooks functionality, test API responses through browser interactions

## 2. Email/Password Authentication with Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Implement traditional email/password authentication flow with email verification functionality.
### Details:
1. Create registration endpoint with proper validation
2. Implement secure password hashing (bcrypt/Argon2) and storage
3. Set up email verification system with secure tokens
4. Create login endpoint with rate limiting
5. Implement password reset functionality
6. Security considerations: Password strength requirements, account lockout after failed attempts, secure email templates
7. Testing: Manually verify registration, login, and verification flows through browser testing; verify password policy enforcement

## 3. OAuth Provider Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Integrate multiple OAuth providers (Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.) for social authentication.
### Details:
1. Set up OAuth client configurations for each provider
2. Implement OAuth callback handlers
3. Create user account linking functionality for multiple auth methods
4. Handle OAuth token refresh and expiration
5. Implement profile data synchronization from OAuth providers
6. Security considerations: Validate OAuth state parameters, secure client secrets, implement proper scopes
7. Testing: Manually verify OAuth authentication through browser testing, verify account linking and unlinking functionality

## 4. Protected Routes and Session Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Implement protected routes, role-based access control, and robust session management.
### Details:
1. Create higher-order components or route guards for protected routes
2. Implement role-based access control system
3. Set up session timeout and renewal mechanisms
4. Create secure logout functionality across devices
5. Implement activity tracking for security purposes
6. Security considerations: JWT validation, session fixation prevention, secure session storage
7. Testing: Manually verify route protection and redirect behavior, test session management across browser sessions, check for session expiration

## 5. Authentication UI Pages [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Design and implement user interface components for all authentication flows.
### Details:
1. Create login page with email/password and social login options
2. Implement registration form with validation
3. Design email verification and password reset pages
4. Create account management interface for linked accounts
5. Implement responsive designs for all authentication pages
6. Security considerations: Implement CAPTCHA for forms, clear sensitive data on component unmount, prevent auto-fill on sensitive fields
7. Testing: Manually verify UI components in browser, test accessibility with keyboard navigation, check compatibility across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari

# Current Task: Project Editing Implementation

## Project Editing and Deletion - Implementation Checklist

### Core Requirements (From task-004-checklist.md)

- [ ] Create edit form
  - [ ] Implement form pre-population with project data
  - [ ] Add validation for edit operations
  - [ ] Create edit history tracking if applicable
  - [ ] Handle concurrent editing conflicts
  - [ ] Show toast notifications for successful edits and validation errors
- [ ] Implement deletion functionality
  - [ ] Create confirmation dialog
  - [ ] Implement soft delete if applicable
  - [ ] Add cascade deletion for related data
  - [ ] Handle permissions for deletion operations
  - [ ] Display toast notifications for successful deletion and errors

### Technical Implementation Steps

#### 1. Create Edit Page Structure

- [x] Create `/src/app/projects/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
- [x] Create `/src/app/projects/[id]/edit/EditProjectForm.tsx` (reusing NewProjectForm)
- [x] Add proper TypeScript interfaces for edit mode

#### 2. Snapshot-Based Editing System

- [x] Implement snapshot creation for edits (new_snapshot_id)
- [x] Create API endpoint for snapshot creation: `/api/projects/[id]/snapshots`
- [x] Handle snapshot publishing logic
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Implement "Publish Draft" functionality
  - [x] Create API endpoint `/api/projects/[id]/publish-draft`
  - [x] Create database function `publish_project_draft`
  - [x] Add server action `publishDraft`
  - [x] Update UI with conditional "Publish Draft" button
- [ ] Implement snapshot rollback functionality (deferred)

#### 3. Form Adaptation

- [x] Modify NewProjectForm to support edit mode
- [x] Pre-populate form with existing project data
- [x] Handle snapshot data vs project data
- [x] Update form submission logic for editing

#### 4. API Enhancements

- [x] Update PUT `/api/projects/[id]` to handle snapshot creation
- [x] Create snapshot management endpoints
- [x] Add proper validation for edit operations
- [x] Implement permission checks for editing

#### 5. Database Changes (if needed)

- [x] Review current schema for snapshot support
- [x] Add any missing indexes or constraints
- [x] Update RLS policies if needed

#### 6. UI/UX Features

- [x] Add "Edit Project" button to project page (already exists in ProjectDetails.tsx)
- [x] Implement draft/publish workflow UI
- [x] **COMPLETED**: "Publish Draft" button with conditional visibility
- [x] Toast notifications for successful operations
- [ ] Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (deferred)
- [ ] Show editing status and draft indicators (deferred)

#### 7. Testing & Validation

- [x] **CRITICAL UX FIX: URL slug uniqueness check**
  - Fixed issue where editing a project would fail slug validation even when slug wasn't changed
  - Updated `/api/projects/check-slug` to accept `currentSlug` parameter
  - Modified `ProjectBasicInfoStep` to skip validation when slug matches current project slug
  - Updated `EditProjectForm` to pass current slug to form component
- [x] Test edit form with existing project data
- [x] Verify snapshot creation and publishing
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Test "Publish Draft" functionality end-to-end
- [x] Test permission-based access to edit functionality
- [x] Validate toast notifications work correctly

### Notes

- Reuse existing `NewProjectForm.tsx` to avoid code duplication
- Follow snapshot-based editing system from data-structure.md
- Skip "Draft Mode and Status Management" and "Rich Text Editing" sections for now
- Mark "Multi-step Project Creation Form" as completed if it's working

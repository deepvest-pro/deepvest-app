# Task ID: 3
# Title: User Profile Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create user profile system with professional information, profile editing, and role-based access control.
# Details:
1. Design user profile database schema in Supabase
2. Create ZOD schema for user profile validation
3. Implement profile creation on user registration
4. Create profile edit form with validation
5. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) system
6. Create user profile page with professional information display
7. Add profile image upload using Supabase storage
8. Implement user settings page
9. Create API endpoints for profile operations
10. Add user role management for administrators

# Test Strategy:
Test profile creation, editing, and retrieval. Verify image uploads work correctly. Test RBAC by attempting actions with different user roles. Ensure validation prevents invalid data submission.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Database Schema and API Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the database schema for user profiles and create the necessary API endpoints for CRUD operations.
### Details:
Database design considerations: Create tables for users, roles, permissions, and user settings with appropriate relationships. Include fields for profile information (name, email, phone, etc.), authentication details, and timestamps. API endpoints needed: GET /users, GET /users/:id, POST /users, PUT /users/:id, DELETE /users/:id. Validation requirements: Ensure proper data types, required fields, and unique constraints. UI components: None for this subtask as it's backend focused.

Database design considerations: Create tables in Supabase for users, roles, permissions, and user settings with appropriate relationships. Include fields for profile information (name, email, phone, etc.), authentication details, and timestamps.

API endpoints needed: Implement NextJS API Routes for CRUD operations - GET /api/users, GET /api/users/[id], POST /api/users, PUT /api/users/[id], DELETE /api/users/[id]. These API routes will interact with Supabase to perform data operations.

Validation requirements: Ensure proper data types, required fields, and unique constraints.

Acceptance criteria:
- Supabase database schema properly implemented with Row Level Security
- NextJS API Routes correctly connected to Supabase client
- API endpoints return proper responses and handle errors appropriately
- Authentication and authorization properly integrated with API endpoints

UI components: None for this subtask as it's backend focused.

## 2. Profile Creation and Editing Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Implement the frontend and backend logic for creating and editing user profiles.
### Details:
Database design considerations: Ensure proper validation rules are implemented in the database layer. Validation requirements: Client and server-side validation for email format, password strength, required fields, and character limits. UI components needed: Registration form, profile edit form, form validation messages, success/error notifications. Implement form submission handlers and API integration.

## 3. Role-Based Access Control Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Implement RBAC system to manage user permissions and access levels throughout the application.
### Details:
Database design considerations: Ensure proper relationships between users, roles, and permissions tables. Create middleware for permission checking. Validation requirements: Validate role assignments, prevent privilege escalation, ensure proper authorization checks. UI components needed: Role management interface, permission assignment forms, access denied screens, conditional rendering based on permissions.

## 4. Profile Image Handling and User Settings [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Implement functionality for uploading, storing, and displaying profile images along with user preference settings.
### Details:
Database design considerations: Store image metadata in the database with file paths/URLs, create user_settings table with preferences. Validation requirements: Validate file types, sizes, and dimensions for images, sanitize user preference inputs. UI components needed: Image upload widget with preview, cropping tool, settings form with toggles/inputs for preferences, notification settings panel.

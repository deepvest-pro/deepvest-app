# Task ID: 8
# Title: Leaderboard with Categories Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create leaderboard system with categorization, filtering, and sorting of startups based on various metrics.
# Details:
1. Design leaderboard database schema in Supabase
2. Create ZOD schema for leaderboard data validation
3. Implement category management system
4. Add leaderboard calculation logic
5. Create leaderboard UI with filtering and sorting
6. Implement category-specific leaderboards
7. Add time-based leaderboard views (weekly, monthly, all-time)
8. Create trending startups algorithm
9. Implement API endpoints for leaderboard operations
10. Add leaderboard widgets for embedding

# Test Strategy:
Test leaderboard calculation and display. Verify filtering and sorting functionality. Test category-specific leaderboards. Ensure trending algorithm works correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Leaderboard Database Schema and Calculation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the database schema and calculation logic for the leaderboard system
### Details:
Create database tables for users, scores, categories, and leaderboard entries. Implement efficient indexing for quick sorting and filtering. Design calculation logic for different scoring metrics (total points, average score, win ratio). Include caching mechanisms for frequently accessed leaderboard data. Consider sharding strategies for horizontal scaling. Implement batch processing for leaderboard updates to avoid performance bottlenecks.

## 2. Category Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop a system to create, update, and manage leaderboard categories
### Details:
Create admin interface for category CRUD operations. Implement category hierarchies (parent/child relationships). Design category metadata schema (icons, descriptions, visibility rules). Build category assignment logic for leaderboard entries. Include category-specific scoring rules and weights. Develop category subscription system for users. Consider performance impact of category filtering on database queries.

## 3. Leaderboard UI with Filtering and Sorting [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Design and implement the user interface for displaying and interacting with leaderboards
### Details:
Create responsive leaderboard grid/table component. Implement client-side sorting and filtering controls. Design category selector/filter UI components. Build pagination or infinite scrolling for large leaderboards. Include user highlighting and position tracking. Develop time period selectors (daily, weekly, monthly, all-time). Optimize rendering performance for large datasets. Create animations for position changes and updates.

## 4. Trending Algorithms and API Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Implement trending calculation algorithms and create API endpoints for leaderboard data
### Details:
Design trending score algorithm (considering recency, velocity of change, etc.). Implement scheduled jobs for trending calculations. Create RESTful API endpoints for leaderboard data access. Build GraphQL schema for flexible data querying. Implement rate limiting and caching for API endpoints. Design webhook system for real-time leaderboard updates. Document API for third-party integrations. Optimize query performance for high-traffic scenarios.

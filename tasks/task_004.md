- **Status:** pending
- **Dependencies:** 3
- **Priority:** high
- **Description:** Implement startup project creation with form validation, draft mode, and basic editing functionality.
- **Details:**
  1. Design project database schema in Supabase
  2. Create ZOD schema for project data validation
  3. Implement multi-step project creation form
  4. Add draft mode functionality for projects
  5. Create project edit form with validation
  6. Implement project deletion with confirmation
  7. Add project status management (draft, published, archived)
  8. Create API endpoints for project CRUD operations
  9. Implement form state management with React Hook Form
  10. Add rich text editor for project descriptions
- **Test Strategy:**
  Test project creation, editing, and deletion. Verify draft mode works correctly. Test validation rules for all project fields. Ensure API endpoints handle errors gracefully.

## Subtasks:

- [ ] **1. Project Database Schema and Validation** `[pending]`

  - **Dependencies:** None
  - **Description:** Design and implement the database schema for projects with appropriate validation rules
  - **Details:**
    Create database models with fields for project title, description, status, timeline, budget, team members, and other relevant attributes. Implement server-side validation rules for required fields, data types, and business logic constraints. Design the schema to support draft mode functionality. Consider relationships with other entities like users, tasks, and resources. Document the schema design and validation rules for team reference.

- [ ] **2. Multi-step Creation Form with Draft Mode** `[pending]`

  - **Dependencies:** 4.1
  - **Description:** Develop a multi-step form interface with draft saving functionality
  - **Details:**
    Create a multi-step form UI with progress indicators and navigation between steps. Implement form state management using a state management library (Redux, Context API, etc.). Add draft mode functionality to automatically save incomplete forms. Implement client-side validation for each step with appropriate error messages. Design responsive UI components that work across devices. Consider UX for returning users to continue from saved drafts.

- [ ] **3. Project Editing and Status Management** `[pending]`

  - **Dependencies:** 4.1, 4.2
  - **Description:** Implement project editing capabilities and status workflow management
  - **Details:**
    Create edit forms that pre-populate with existing project data. Implement status transitions (draft, active, completed, archived) with appropriate validation rules for each transition. Design UI components for status indicators and status change actions. Implement optimistic UI updates with proper error handling. Consider permission checks for different user roles. Add confirmation dialogs for critical actions like status changes or deletions.

- [ ] **4. Rich Text Editing and API Endpoints** `[pending]`
  - **Dependencies:** 4.1, 4.3
  - **Description:** Integrate rich text editing capabilities and develop necessary API endpoints
  - **Details:**
    Select and integrate a rich text editor component for project descriptions. Implement sanitization and validation for rich text content. Develop RESTful API endpoints for project CRUD operations, status changes, and draft management. Add proper error handling and response formatting for API endpoints. Consider performance optimizations for rich text content storage and retrieval. Implement API documentation using Swagger or similar tools.

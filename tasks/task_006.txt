# Task ID: 6
# Title: Project Snapshot Versioning
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement project snapshot system to track changes and versions of startup projects over time.
# Details:
1. Design snapshot database schema in Supabase
2. Create ZOD schema for snapshot data validation
3. Implement snapshot creation on project updates
4. Add snapshot comparison functionality
5. Create snapshot history view
6. Implement snapshot restoration
7. Add snapshot metadata (timestamp, author, change summary)
8. Create API endpoints for snapshot operations
9. Implement optimistic updates for snapshot creation
10. Add snapshot diffing visualization

# Test Strategy:
Test snapshot creation on project updates. Verify snapshot history displays correctly. Test snapshot comparison and restoration functionality. Ensure snapshots accurately capture all project data.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Snapshot Database Schema and Storage Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the database schema and storage strategy for project snapshots
### Details:
Define data structures for storing snapshot data efficiently. Consider using a combination of full and incremental snapshots to optimize storage. Design schema to include snapshot metadata (timestamp, author, version number). Implement compression techniques for large datasets. Evaluate storage options (blob storage vs. relational tables). Create indexes for fast snapshot retrieval. Document schema design decisions and storage optimization strategies.

## 2. Snapshot Creation and Metadata Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Implement functionality to create project snapshots and track associated metadata
### Details:
Develop snapshot creation mechanism with configurable frequency options. Implement metadata capture including timestamp, user, commit message, and version tags. Create background process for automated snapshots. Add validation to prevent corrupt snapshots. Optimize snapshot creation process for large projects. Design notification system for snapshot creation events. Include progress indicators for long-running snapshot operations.

## 3. Snapshot History and Comparison UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Design and implement user interface for browsing snapshot history and initiating comparisons
### Details:
Create timeline view of project snapshots with filtering capabilities. Design snapshot details panel showing metadata and changes summary. Implement snapshot search functionality. Create UI for selecting two snapshots to compare. Add snapshot tagging and labeling features. Design responsive layouts for different screen sizes. Include accessibility considerations for the history browser. Create mockups and conduct usability testing.

## 4. Restoration Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Implement functionality to restore projects to previous snapshot states
### Details:
Develop restoration process with conflict resolution strategy. Implement validation to ensure data integrity during restoration. Create restoration preview capability. Add option for partial restorations of specific components. Design confirmation dialogs with clear warnings about data changes. Implement rollback capability for failed restorations. Optimize restoration performance for large datasets. Add detailed logging of restoration operations.

## 5. Diffing Visualization and API Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Create visual diff tools and API endpoints for snapshot comparison and integration
### Details:
Implement visual diff tool showing side-by-side and inline comparison views. Create specialized diff visualizations for different data types (text, images, structured data). Design color-coding scheme for additions, deletions, and modifications. Implement API endpoints for programmatic access to snapshots and diffs. Add export functionality for diff reports. Optimize diff algorithm for performance with large datasets. Create documentation for API endpoints with usage examples.
